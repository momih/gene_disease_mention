# Finding gene-disease relations through Keras
Some code files for COSC 526, giving functions for downloading and extracting relevant sentences from research papers on PubMed Central and labelling them as containing a gene-disease mention or not. More functions on converting to word vectors and training an LSTM. 
The code files are a bit disconnected with each other, will be resolving that soon.
